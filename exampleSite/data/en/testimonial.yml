    date: '"Vlad is caring, insightful, and truly helpful."'
    content: Vlad is a superb listener, which in my experience, is a rare find. Too
      many times in our daily life we met people who listen to reply and not to actually
      understand. Now Vlad is not like that. He has a way to make you feel comfortable
      to open up and by the end of your sentence, he always comes up with smart, thought-provoking
      responses that help you to reflect on your problems and focus on the light at
      the end of the tunnel. Vlad is caring, insightful, and truly helpful. Every
      coaching session with him is a time well spent, which I sincerely recommend
      for anyone feeling lost or stuck in their life!

      I really appreciate you offering me your time, energy, and open heart to listen to my situation. However long the time I took pouring out all my emotions, it only felt like minutes. Thank you for enlightening me and reminding me of things that I‘ve forgotten.
      Your energy has filled up mine and revived me to get back to my life with a clear head and positive outlook.

      much clarity out of them. He really puts you at ease with his calm demeanour
      while he helps you address and figure out the issue at hand yourself. I warmly
      recommend to each and everyone - no matter what life situation they are dealing

    date: '"I did not feel lost anymore, but empowered."'
    content: Based on our discussion and thanks to the meaningful questions Vlad raised
      I decided to pursue my goal about blogging. He comforted me the whole time making
      sure that I did not feel lost anymore, but empowered. Vlad's observations helped
      me realize some of my misbeliefs and overcome them - all this in a patient,
      thoughtful manner.

    date: '"Amazing at piecing together what you’re telling him."'
    content: Vlad is amazing at piecing together what you’re telling him. He listens
      fully immersed, never forgets a thing and points out the red thread holding
      together one’s stories by asking the most insightful questions. He helped me
      connect with a side of myself by holding the space for me to give voice to that
      part. I enjoy his style because it balances out the inquisitive nature of coaching
      with playful elements that led me to insightful AHA! moments.

    date: '"A great listener."'
    content: Vlad is a great listener and asks very insightful questions which prompt
      you to see the problem / situation in a different light. He helped me to get
      a new perspective on things which I could not unpick for years. And this empowered
      me to make choices instead of feeling stuck. I would recommend you to work with
      Vlad if you feel stuck in certain areas of your life and you are looking to
      gain crystal clarity on the next steps.

    date: '"A very intuitive coach."'
    content: I gained a much deeper level of understanding as he skillfully managed
      to take me to look at certain areas I was avoiding due to past pain. It was
      an emotional journey of self-discovery to walk past the stories in my head and
      see the truth. I had an amazing aha! moment in which I knew with clarity what
      was the next step for me to take to improve my situation. I warmly recommend
      Vlad to anybody who is ready to challenge their beliefs/fears and see the truth
      to change his/her life.
