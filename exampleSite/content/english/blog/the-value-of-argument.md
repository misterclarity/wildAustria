Imagine a thunderstorm. Lighting bolts illuminating the dark clouds. Booming thunder restoring perspective. Rain washing away the debris. Once it is over, a smell of fresh air emanates from the ground and surrounds you. Every inhale seems to bring extra energy, and the animals previously hidden come out of their hiding. Congratulations, you've just experienced an "argument". A thunderstorm is nature's way of balancing out pent up energy that's become stagnant. Similarly, in our relationships we need an argument from time to time to wash away the debris that gathers up between two people in a relationship. So go ahead, fight things out with a partner, friend, or colleague while keeping in mind the clarity and restored perspective that follows. It helps to let go of any negative emotions that come up during the argument in order to get the most out of your "thunderstorms". Happy rainy day!
