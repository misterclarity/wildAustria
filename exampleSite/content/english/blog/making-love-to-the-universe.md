Take you meditation with you during the day. Make every breath a fully awakened intake. Know that every move makes the universe revel in extacy, thus it bathes you with its energy and love. Life becomes a meditation, action becomes caresses, and meeting people becomes a form of worship. Highest positive regard for yourself as well as anyone crossing your path.
