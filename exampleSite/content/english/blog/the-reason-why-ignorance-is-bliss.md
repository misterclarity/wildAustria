Look back on a time when you were enjoying a particular activity or role beyond anything else. At some point you came to the realization that on a certain **newly discovered level** of yourself, that activity does not bring satisfaction. Or even worse, it brings dissatisfaction, guilt, and a certain amount of rejection from others. One way to interpret that time would be to say that you were being ignorant. Unaware of your entire self. Limited in awareness. Perhaps wounded, seeking escape. And that ignorance allowed you to delve into that particular activity with **full abandon**. Once awareness starts to build up, however, that abandon is no longer possible and it might even turn 180 degrees to become rejection. At that point, going back is no longer possible, yet one's advance can become similar to a crab walking backwards. With one eye turned towards the past, perhaps in the form of regret, since the abandon was such an intense and pleasurable experience. However, new forms of abandon can be found. Forms which are more aligned with the person you have the potential and desire to be. Abandon which allows more refined and expanded awareness. Abandon that is wholesome and creates value for yourself and those around you.
