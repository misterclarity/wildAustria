It's a good thing that nobody has ultimate control. If anyone did, and they would decide to start using that control over others, or over situations in order to get ahead of others, the world balance would be under threat.

Communism and equality: people are not actually equal, regardless of the political system. Equality in politics or in coaching is contextual. Politically, the context needs to offer equal basic rights for that which is truly similar, namely that we are all human. Any expectation beyond that basic rights equality, for example the equality of outcome, is an illusion and a misappropriation.

I realized that I am highly vulnerable all of the time. And that this vulnerability needs my compassion all the time.

Love vs authenticity

Stress = brain & body are out of homeostasys. It comes from adverse or very demanding circumstances when we can't predict an outcome, can't control the situation, or perceive a threat, danger, etc.

In stress mode, the attention is on the outer environment, on time, and body. Where to run, hide, what to fight. The more we focus on externals, the more material we become. And we begin to seek control over the material world.
