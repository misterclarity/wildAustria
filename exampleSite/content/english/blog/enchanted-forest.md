Imagine walking with a lantern through an enchanted forest. Every trinket, every leaf of grass, every breath of air is magical. Life seems loaded with a value and meaning which inspire awe and wonder. Your lantern helps you find your way through, with your heart in awe and your mind wondering. The forest walk brings all the answers, solves all the problems. Walk on, my friend. Walk on!
