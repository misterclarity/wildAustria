Imagine walking with a lantern through an enchanted forest. Every trinket, every leaf of grass, every breath of air is magical. Everything is loaded with a value and meaning which inspire awe and wonder. The coach's lantern is there as well, to help you find you way through, with your heart in awe and your mind wonder-ing. This forest walk brings all the answers, solves all the problems. Walk on, my friend. Walk on!
