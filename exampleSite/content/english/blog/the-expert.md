A coaching session is said to have no expert. I tend to disagree with this principle. While this is meant as a reminder to the coach that the client is creative, resourceful, and whole, during my coaching practice I have noticed there is always an expert present. Namely, **the client**.

Often in life we listen to advice from seemingly wise sources, from bosses, from books, from friends and family, from scientists, etc. We sometimes forget that in terms of our own lives, there is only one true expert. Our **Self**. It is an inner guide that remains steadfast no matter what happens externally. This presence is to be found in various ways (meditation, spirituality, exercise, play, creativity, etc.), but rarely does engaging with societal structures bring its voice to the foreground.

Take comfort in knowing that this guiding presence is by your side all the time. Be grateful for it. A coaching session is centered around the awareness of the expert Self and places you in the best possible relationship with its nature.
