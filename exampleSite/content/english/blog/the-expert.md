+++
Often in life we listen to advice from seemingly wise sources, from bosses, from books, from friends and family, from scientists, etc. We can sometimes forget that in terms of our own lives, there is only one true expert. Our **Self**. It is an inner guide that remains steadfast no matter what happens externally. This presence is to be found in various ways (meditation, spirituality, exploration, exercise, play, creativity, etc.), but rarely does engaging with societal structures bring its voice to the foreground.

Take comfort in knowing that this guiding presence is by your side all the time. Be grateful for it. Travel and exploration are excellent tonics for the expert **Self**, ensuring the best possible relationship with its essence.
