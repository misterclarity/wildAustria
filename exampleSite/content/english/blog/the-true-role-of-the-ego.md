The Ego is bad. That is the current narrative. I am here to tell you that the Ego is very useful once we understand its true purpose. It is meant to be an **affirming presence**. The best way to understand the healthy role of the Ego is the parallel to a company. Imagine a large corporation. Many layers of employees with one CEO at the top. The CEO is a central figure. Every employee, no matter the department, knows him/her. The CEO communicates regularly, and even the most hierarchically distant person has an idea of what they look like and at least partially, what they stand for. The CEO is a **creature of habit**. Someone who needs and enforces rules with wisdom and compassion. Let's imagine further that this large corporation has a single location. One building where all departments are located. From the warehouse and production facilities at the bottom to the administrative offices at the top. At some point throughout the day, the CEO must do the rounds. He/she is meant to walk through the building and shake hands with every single employee. This is the equivalent of the Ego becoming directing its awareness to every part of your psyche in order to **integrate** it and **create a feeling of unity**.
