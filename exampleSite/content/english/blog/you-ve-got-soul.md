Imagine a presence so pure that merely coming close to it brings you to tears of awe.  A being that needs connection and nurturing in return for lifelong support and fulfillment. Vulnerable, but not helpless. A being so powerful that its manifestation during a crysis can seem like magic. It does not belong to you, yet it is uniquely connected to you for life. It is a delicate bond that you share and the connection it needs from you is a small price to pay for the wealth it provides. Does this sound familiar? Have you already met your Soul?
